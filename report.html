For Project 1, the objective was to create a website that met specific requirements, including the use of multiple
pages, media queries, and form elements. This report will detail how I met these expectations and provide a link to the
PDF of my design sketch.

1. multiple pages: I created a total of 6 pages for website including the home page (index.html), about page, contact
page, digital page, exec page, index page, report page and Upcoming events.

2. Favicon: I included a favicon on all pages of my website, which is a woman on the computer icon that appears in the
browser tab. I used the same favicon for all pages to create consistency throughout the site.

3. Header and Navigation: Each page of my website includes a header section with the site title and a navigation menu
that links to all other pages. The navigation is in the header on desktop.

4. Media Queries: I used media queries to adjust the layout of my website based on screen size. On larger screens, the
exec items are arranged in a grid, while on smaller screens they are displayed in a single column. I also adjusted the
size of some images and text to ensure they were viewable on all devices.

5. Images and Alt Attributes: I included images on several pages of my website, including the about and exec pages. All
images have alt attributes that describe the content of the image to users with screen readers or images disabled.

6. Validation: I used the Nu Validator and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator to ensure that all pages and stylesheets of
my website validate without any warnings or errors.

7. Font Faces: I used two different font faces throughout my website, with headings displayed in a sans-serif font and
paragraph text in a serif font.

8. Form element: I have email list entry on the contact page. The form includes built-in content verification to ensure
that users enter valid information.

9. External Links: I included links to external websites on several pages of my website, including a link to the Women
in Technology LinkedIn and the Instagram.
